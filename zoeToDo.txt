fix pyenchant.  was a complete pain in the ass to install and get working.  ***WAS THROWING VIRUS FLAGS ON MY MACHINE***  malwr.com and virustotal were clean tho.
integrate into main bits.  Word verification doesn't need it's own class since it's like 3 lines.
look into auto installing pyenchant or packaging the required C/C++ files for it. *****SEE ABOVE.  WTF*****
one more test suite. I had it in my mind then forgot.  HERP DERP
write change to word trunc'er to capitlise everything.  Checks back true for "the", "The", and "THE".  False for "tHe" or "thE".  \\
Obs enchant gives a shit about capitals somewhat.
